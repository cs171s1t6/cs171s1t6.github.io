                        Food waste is one of the most pressing issues our planet is facing in these days.
                        Since cheap food has become more accessible than ever, the amount of wasted food
                        has increased enormously. In fact, about 1.3 Gigatonnes of food waste are produced worldwide every year.
                        In this article we discuss the problem of food waste from a global, local and personal perspective.
                        We begin by discussing what countries on a global scale produce most waste
                        and which products are most often thrown away.
                        In the second step, we will break our results down to a local level and
                        discuss the food waste problem in Massachusetts.
                        Here we will identify the top waste producing counties as well as their top waste producers.
                        Finally, we will discuss how everyone of us can make a huge impact
                        on the food waste problem via food banks.

                        About 1/3 of the total food produced globally goes to waste, and this is costing the world approximately USD 750 billion.! For example, in America it’s estimated that 1860000 tones of food were wasted in 2011.
                        This corresponds to 6000 airplanes with cargo- putting them together they will create a line long enough to cover the distance BOSTON - PARIS.
                        However, some countries waste more food than others - many factors come into play.
                        One of these factors is income, another one is expense on food.
                        Naturally we expect, that these factors must be directly correlated to food waste.
                        After all, the more money you have, the more you can spend on food and the more food potentially goes to waste.
                        In the visualization below we present a data-based analysis of this hypothesis.
                        Furthermore we analyze the amount of food wasted per country via a choropleth map
                        and show how food waste for different product types evolve over time.

                        The way the visualization works is very simple: First, choose a type food category
                        that you are interested. Then select a time interval. All graphs will automatically
                        adapt to your choice. First, the choropleth world map will show you the total global distribution
                        of waste for you chosen category for the the time intervall you have chosen.
                        Second, the line chart shows you how the total worldwide foodwaste for your chosen
                        period relates to average income and to average expense on food.
                        Finally you can detect temporal trends in the waste for your chosen category via
                        the stacked area chart.

                        Our main findings are the following: First, on a per-capita basis, much more food is wasted in the industrialized world than in developing countries.
                        Second, cereals and high calory foods are the biggest contributor to food waste.
                        (Did you know that - <i>cereals provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop?</i>)
                        Third, Food waste is not static; across the years levels of food wasted per country have changed, as well per food type.
                        And finally, countries with higher average income tend to waste more food.

                        Food waste is not only a global problem. It is also a critical local issue in the state of Massachusetts.
                        On this local level there are a large variety of different contributors to food waste
                        ranging from restaurant, to universities, to supermarkets and many more.
                        Also the different counties and zip code areas of Massachusetts contribute differently to the total food waste.
                        An interesting task is to analyze these different contributions based on data.
                        For that purpose we have created the visualization below.
                        In the choropleth map on the right you can see the absolute waste contributions of
                        different institutions, such as universities, hospitals, grocery stores and so on.
                        It also allows you to determine which regions (or more explicitly zip code areas) contribute most of the waste.
                        The sunburst chart on the left gives an insight into relative waste contributions.
                        It allows you to figure out the percentage of how much different institutions, counties
                        and zip code regions contribute to the total waste.

                        Our conclusions from this analysis are twofold: First,
                        we determined that the main contributions to the total waste come
                        from restaurant, followed by supermarkets and food manufacturers.
                        Second, we find that urban areas, such as Boston, contribute highly to the food waste.
                        This is only to be expected due to the high density of restaurants, supermarkets
                        and colleges which all contribute a great deal to the total waste.

                    In this article we have discussed the topic of food waste.
                    The problem itself is highly important and timely, since
                    the amount of wasted food is dramatically increasing over the recent years.
                    In more detail, we have explored the different facets of the topic on the global, local and personal level.
                    First, on the global level we have compared the food waste produced by different
                    countries and analyzed its temporal evolution.
                    Second, on the local level we have discussed the different contributors to food waste
                    by picking the state of Massachusetts as an example.
                    Finally, we gave explicit recommendations how everyone can reduce her or his personal food waste.
