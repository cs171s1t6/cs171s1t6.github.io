                        <p>Food waste has an ecological and economical impact that permeates through all aspects of our life.</p>
                        <p>You can help to turn it around, by taking some small steps - and STOP WASTING FOOD.</p>
                        <p>There is a lot you can doto reduce the amount of food waste you and your close ones produce.  Some tips for you:</p>
                        <p><strong>Shop Wisely</strong> - plan your meals, try not to fall for impulse buys that you will later throw away.</p>
                        <p><strong>Buy fruit and vegetables of all size and colors</strong> - a lot of fruits and vegetables go to waste because they don’t look like in the magazines, but even funny looking ones taste delicious.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eat leftovers</strong> - there is nothing wrong with asking for a doggy bag after eating out - you can enjoy it later or the next day.</p>
                        <p><strong>Donate Food:</strong> you can donate that extra food instead of throwing it away to food banks or food pantries</p>
                        <p><strong>There are many institutions like these close to you, check this map to find the closest to you. </strong></p>
                        <p>You can also encourage your friends and family to donate theirs.</p>
