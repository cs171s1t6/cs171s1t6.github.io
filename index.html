                        Food waste is one of the most pressing issues our planet is facing in these days.
                        Since cheap food has become more accessible than ever, the amount of wasted food
                        has increased enormously. In fact, <strong> about 1.3 Gigatonnes </strong> of food waste are
                        produced worldwide every year.<br>

                        In this site you'll be able to explore the problem of food waste from a global, local and personal perspective.<br>

                        <h3  style= "color: #992226"> Global </h3>
                        You can start by looking at this issue from a global point of view  –
                        for example you can check which  countries on a global scale produce most waste
                        and which products are most often thrown away.


                        <h3  style= "color: #41AB5D">Local</h3>

                        If you are interested in diving in the local perspective in the second part of this website
                        and you live in the Massachuttets area, go to the second part of the website.
                        There you will be able to identify the top waste producing counties as well as their top waste producers.

                        We all have a play to part regarding food waste –

                        <p>About 1/3 of the total food produced globally goes to waste, and this is costing the world approximately <strong>USD 750 billion!</strong>
                        For example, in America it’s estimated that 1860000 tones of food were wasted in 2011.</p>
                        <p>This corresponds to 6000 airplanes with cargo- putting them together they will create a line long enough to cover the distance BOSTON - PARIS.</p>

                        <p>However, some countries waste more food than others - many factors come into play.
                        One of these factors is income, another one is expense on food.</p>

                        <p>Naturally we expect, that these factors must be directly correlated to food waste.
                        After all, the more money you have, the more you can spend on food and the more food potentially goes to waste.</p>

                        <p>In the visualizations below we present a data-based analysis of this hypothesis, and it provides with the opportunity to explore
                            the amount of food wasted per country, the distribution of this waste ( food types) and it’s evolution over time.</p>

                        <h5 style="color:#992226">The way the visualization works is very simple:</h5>
                        <p>1 - Choose a type food category that you are interested. From the <strong> FOOD TYPE</strong> dropdown.</p>
                        <p>2 - Select a time interval. Using the <strong> YEAR RANGE </strong> slider.</p>
                        <p><i>All graphs will automatically adapt to your choice. </i></p>
                        <p>The world map will show you the total global distribution of waste for you chosen category for the
                        time interval you have chosen. The bar chart shows you how the total worldwide food waste for your
                        chosen period relates to average income and to average expense on food.
                        You can detect temporal trends in the waste for your chosen category via the stacked area chart.</p>

                        <p>1) On a per-capita basis, much more food is wasted in the industrialized world than in developing countries.</p>

                        <p>2) Cereals and high calorie foods are the biggest contributor to food waste. <i>Did you know that - 
                            cereals provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop?</i></p>

                        <p>3) Food waste is not static; across the year’s levels of food wasted per country have changed, as well per food type.</p>

                        <p>4) Countries with higher average income tend to waste more food.</p>

                        <p>Food waste is not only a global problem. It is also a critical local issue in the state of Massachusetts.
                        On this local level there are a large variety of different contributors to food waste ranging from restaurant,
                        to universities, to supermarkets and many more.</p>

                        <p>Also the different counties and zip code areas of Massachusetts contribute differently to the total food waste.</p>

                        <p>An interesting task is to analyze these different contributions based on data.<h5 style="color:#41AB5D">For that purpose you can use the visualization below.</h5> </p>

                        <p>In the map on the right you can see the absolute waste contributions of different institutions,
                        such as universities, hospitals, grocery stores and so on. It also allows you to determine which regions
                        (or more explicitly zip code areas) contribute most of the waste.</p>

                        <p>The sunburst chart on the left gives an insight into relative waste contributions.
                            It allows you to figure out the percentage of how much different institutions, counties
                            and zip code regions contribute to the total waste.</p>

                <p> 1 - We determined that the main contributions to the total waste come from restaurant,
                    followed by supermarkets and food manufacturers.</p>

                <p> 2 - We find that urban areas, such as Boston,
                contribute highly to the food waste. This is only to be expected due to the high density of restaurants,
                supermarkets and colleges which all contribute a great deal to the total waste.</p>
